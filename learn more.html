		Believe it or not, Reticence didn't start out like this.
	</h1>
		<div>
			<p>In the earlier days of Reticence, the now massive corporation actually started off smaller than you may realize!
			</p>
			<p>
				Starting off as a tiny pharmaceutical store in Colorado, Reti Pharmaceutics was owned and ran by Kenneth Reti the 2nd. A former Vietnamese War veteran, Kenneth worked as a combat medic before he was forced into early retirement. Because of this, he worked the remmainder of his life in the Pharmaceutical industry till his early death due to complications with heart disease.

		The Next Heir
	</h2>

			<p>Even with the death of it's creature, Reti Pharmaceutics soon find it's end in the 1980's but also an uprise in sales and development growth. Quite the opposite, Reti Pharmaceutics steadily increased and expanding out of Colorado and across the US throughout the next few years. The head of the Pharmaceutical turned organiation was one Matthew Reti, who eventually rebranded the organization into the renewable energy corporation Reticence, as it's new head and CEO. Though is truth, little is truly known about the man or his connection to the Reti bloodline; Kenneth had few siblings still alive and most were now coming of age. Nevertheless, the remaining family members cut ties with their alleged descendant with little to no way of contanct any either.
